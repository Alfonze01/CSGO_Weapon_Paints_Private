# Francisco Weapon Paints 4.0.3
Leaked by xCoderx(https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=286016)

This repo is based on xCoderx's leaked sp file, and I'm trying to make it work in game.

## How To Use
Put files into your server

## How To Add Different Language Skin Name 
You can find skin ID in "csgo/scripts/itemsitems_game.txt"

You can find skin name in "csgo/resource/csgo_xxx.txt"

You can find sourcemod languages name in "configs/languages.cfg"

And name your weapon paints cfg to "csgo_wpaints_yoursourcemodlanguagename".

For example, English is "csgo_wpaints_english.cfg", Russian is "csgo_wpaints_Russian.cfg"

## To Do
Add new skins, "The Gamma Collection", "The Gamma 2 Collection" and "The Glove Collection"
